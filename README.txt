About this document:
  This document will serve as an explanation of the purpose and use of each class, function, and library contained in each file as
the project is developed. It will also show the division of labor between group members. The contents of this file will change
consistantly over the course of development.

//A description of the problem you are trying to solve.
The concept of our project is to create and implement a multiplayer card-game application. In this game, players will be given 3 cards with phrases that they have to propose the best caption to a specific picture (or meme). There will be a judge on each round that will choose the best caption, the person that played that card will earn 1 point. This card-game is primarily made to have fun and make comic scenarios for everyone to enjoy.

//Any details regarding instructions for the user interface that is beyond the obvious.
There must be 3 players (client connections) in order to start the game.
First run server.py and then GUItest.py

//A list of Python libraries you are using.
- Socket
- Thread
- Pickle
- PyGame
- Tkinter

//A list of other resources.

//Descriptions of any extra features implemented (beyond the project proposal).
//Include a description of the separation of work (who was responsible for what pieces of the program).
This group project was divided in 4 categories, one for each teammate however, half of the group abandoned the project therefore:
Alec Walter worked on the GUI development, game mechanics and image/phrase card storage.
Virginia Sicuriello worked on the Networking of the game.

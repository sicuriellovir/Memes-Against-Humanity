  The project will be split into 4 main components. The plan for development of these components is decribed below. Note that
these objectives don't necessarily have to be implemented in the order they are presented here.
  
Networking (Virginia Sicuriello):
  - Create a server using:
    + Socket function to create a socket object.
    + Bind function to specify a port.
    + Thread function to allow the completion of tasks that will be performed. 
    + Accept method to wait until a client connects.
  - Create a client using:
    + Socket function that opens a connection to hostname on the port.
    + Connecting the clients to the server to send information to and from the server.
Networking progress: To start testing how networking works, currently, client.py and server.py are testing how the server-side 
                     will handle multiple connections by asking for a username and sending messages that the clients, as well 
                     as the server, can see. As the project progresses, the networking task will change to be linked with the GUI.
                     
GUI (Alec Walter):
  - Creation of a main menu with buttons to connect to a game, change options (such as background colors), and exit the program.
  - Creation of a pre-game screen with a "ready" button. When all connected players select the ready button, the game starts.
  - Create a "view" for each non-judge player in a given round. Each non-judge player should be prompted to select from one of
    their seven cards.
  - Create a "view" for the judge of a given round. The judge should wait for each non-judge to select a card, then be prompted
    to choose from those cards.
  - Once a player reaches a certain number of points, a screen indicating their win should be shown along with an option to
    return to the main menu or exit the program.

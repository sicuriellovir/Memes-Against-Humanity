  The project will be split into 4 main components. The plan for development of these components is decribed below. Note that
these objectives don't necessarily have to be implemented in the order they are presented here.
  
Networking (Virginia Sicuriello):
  
  
GUI (Alec Walter):
  - Creation of a main menu with buttons to connect to a game, change options (such as background colors), and exit the program.
  - Creation of a pre-game screen with a "ready" button. When all connected players select the ready button, the game starts.
  - Create a "view" for each non-judge player in a given round. Each non-judge player should be prompted to select from one of
    their seven cards.
  - Create a "view" for the judge of a given round. The judge should wait for each non-judge to select a card, then be prompted
    to choose from those cards.
  - Once a player reaches a certain number of points, a screen indicating their win should be shown along with an option to
    return to the main menu or exit the program.

Mechanics:


Storage/retrieval of cards:
